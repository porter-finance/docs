# Options

An option gives the holder the right to buy or sell a particular token at a specified price (the [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)) for a certain period of time. There are two kinds of options, calls and puts. [Calls](call-options.md) allow the holder to lock in a price at which to buy the token. [Puts](put-options.md) allow the holder to lock in the selling price. Options don’t last forever, though, they have an [expiration date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expiration-date.asp). After this date, the holder can no longer buy or sell the token at the strike price and the option is worthless.
