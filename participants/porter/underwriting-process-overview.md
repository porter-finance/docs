# Underwriting process overview

## Summary

Porter Finance attempts to mitigate the risk of lending to DAOs by performing a credit analysis on them before allowing a bond issuance. This process is based on a review of six key factors that predict the probability of a DAO defaulting on their debt. These factors include character, capital, capacity, conditions, collateral, and contracts. The majority of lenders review most of this information prior to allowing a borrower to take on debt.

## Character/credit&#x20;

### Character/credit components

#### Current debts&#x20;

* Does the DAO have debt positions in existing lending platforms?&#x20;
* What are they doing with borrowed funds?&#x20;

#### Credit history&#x20;

* Has the DAO followed up on promises made?&#x20;
* Have they made users whole in the event of a hack?&#x20;

#### Team&#x20;

* Is the team anonymous?
* Has the team successfully implemented before?&#x20;
* Does the team have a reputation?&#x20;
* Do the team's actions indicate long term thinking?
* Does the team have investors or advisors who can help them?

### Reducing character/credit risk&#x20;

* Require more collateral&#x20;
* Require less volatile, more liquid, large market cap collateral (wBTC, ETH)

## Capital&#x20;

### Capital components

#### Current savings&#x20;

* Does the DAO have reserves?

### Reducing capital risk&#x20;

* Have an investor or another DAO act as a guarantor

## Capacity&#x20;

### Capacity components

#### Historical finances&#x20;

* Cash flow statement&#x20;
* Profit/loss statement&#x20;
* Balance sheet

#### Cash flow sources

* Is cash flow source sustainable?&#x20;
* What does it depend on?&#x20;
* Is it market dependent?&#x20;

#### Business projections

* What assumptions exist?

#### Cost sources

* Are cost sources variable?
* What do they depend on?
* Are they market dependent?

### Reducing capacity risk&#x20;

* Reduce loan amount
* Consider worst case scenario
* Question all projection assumptions
* Require reduction of existing debt

## Conditions&#x20;

### Conditions components

#### Competition

* How much traction does the DAO's business have?
* Do they have competitors?

#### Use of funds

* How does the DAO plan on using the funds?

#### Local economy

* Which blockchains does the DAO's do business on?
  * What is the risk associated with this blockchain?
  * Is this blockchain's adoption growing or shrinking?

#### Specific industry

* What industry is the DAO in?
* Is this industry growing or shrinking?

#### Legislation

* How likely is it relevant legislation will be passed during the loan term?
* If legislation were to be enacted, how would it affect the DAO's business?

### Reducing conditions risk&#x20;

* Perform market study&#x20;
* Use conservative financial projections

## Collateral&#x20;

### Collateral components

#### Collateral value&#x20;

* Discount collateral to allow for depreciation, transaction sale/costs&#x20;
* Make sure collateral will be valuable at end of loan term&#x20;
* Loan amount should not exceed discounted collateral value
* Does the collateral [pose any risks](https://docs.porter.finance/portal/resources/risks#mitigating-collateral-token-risk)?

### Reducing collateral risk&#x20;

* More collateral
* Make sure it’s valuable to borrower
* Lower volatility collateral&#x20;
* Higher volume collateral&#x20;
* Higher market cap collateral&#x20;
* Reduce loan amount

## Contracts

### Contracts components

#### Audits

* Are the DAO's smart contracts audited?
* Who audited the smart contracts?
* Have the contracts been changed since the audit?

#### Insurance

* Does the DAO partner with a third party to offer smart contract insurance?
* How much smart contract insurance is offered in relation to funds in the protocol?

### Reducing contract risk

* Request additional audit to be performed
* Request smart contract insurance be offered
